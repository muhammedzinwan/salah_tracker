  - Enables clearing prayer backlogs from previous days

### Fixed - Calendar Prayer Logging

  - Alert appears if date has any prayers with `PrayerStatus.missed` or `PrayerStatus.notPerformed`
  - Makes it easy to identify dates with backlogs at a glance
  - Positioned at top-right (size: 8px) to not interfere with bottom status marker

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-16 (Build 6)

### Fixed - iOS Notification Actions
- **Fixed iOS notification action buttons not properly marking prayers**
  - Updated `_handleNotificationTap` in `app.dart` to correctly parse date from notification payload
  - Now uses the date from the payload instead of `DateTime.now()` to ensure correct date handling

  - Created `_refreshAppState()` method that invalidates all time-sensitive providers:
    - Date providers (`currentAppDateProvider`, `todayDateProvider`)
    - Prayer time providers (`todayPrayerTimesProvider`, `nextPrayerProvider`, `currentPrayerProvider`)
    - Prayer log providers (`todayPrayerLogsProvider`, `monthlyStatsProvider`)
  - App now automatically refreshes when resumed, ensuring current prayer times are always displayed
  - Fixed issue where app would be stuck showing old prayer (e.g., Fajr when it's actually Isha time)
  - Added proper lifecycle observer cleanup in `dispose()` method

### Added - Imports
- **Added required imports to `app.dart`**
  - Imported `core/providers/date_providers.dart` for date provider invalidation

## [1.0.6] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed - Missed Prayer Detection System
- **Fixed prayers showing "not logged" instead of being auto-marked as "missed"**
  - Root cause: Isha prayer cutoff was set to next day's Fajr time (~5:30 AM), but forced day transition occurred at 3:00 AM
  - This created a blind spot between 3:00 AM - 5:30 AM where yesterday's Isha was abandoned before its cutoff time passed
  - The automatic detection only checked the current app date, never looking back at previous days
  - Result: Prayers from previous days were never auto-marked as missed after day transition

### Changed - Prayer Cutoff Times
- **Updated Isha prayer cutoff time to align with forced transition**
  - Changed from next day's Fajr time to 4:00 AM (fixed time)
  - Modified `calculatePrayerCutoffTimes()` in `prayer_time_service.dart:145-183`
  - Isha now gets auto-marked as missed at 4 AM if not logged
  - Ensures Isha is marked before day transition occurs
  - Aligns with Islamic principle that Isha must be prayed before Fajr
  - Removed dependency on calculating next day's prayer times for Isha cutoff

### Changed - Day Transition Timing
- **Updated forced transition time from 3 AM to 4 AM**
  - Modified `forcedTransitionHour` constant from 3 to 4 in `app_constants.dart:47`
  - Grace period now: 00:00 - 04:00 (allows 4 hours to log previous day's prayers)
  - Prevents blind spot that was causing prayers to be abandoned
  - More user-friendly: gives extra hour for users who pray Isha very late

### Added - Transition Safety Hook
- **Added automatic cleanup of incomplete prayers during day transition**
  - Created `_markYesterdayIncompletePrayers()` helper function in `date_providers.dart:104-136`
  - Runs automatically when forced transition occurs at 4 AM
  - Checks all of yesterday's prayers and auto-marks any unlogged prayers as missed
  - Provides safety net to catch any prayers that slipped through detection cycle
  - Ensures no prayers are ever abandoned without being marked
  - Error handling prevents blocking day transition if cleanup fails

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` - Updated forced transition hour
  - `lib/features/prayers/services/prayer_time_service.dart` - Changed Isha cutoff logic
  - `lib/core/providers/date_providers.dart` - Added transition cleanup hook

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ All prayers will be auto-marked as missed when their cutoff time passes
- ‚úÖ No more prayers showing "not logged" when they should be "missed"
- ‚úÖ Isha being missed will not block next day's Fajr from being marked
- ‚úÖ Day transition at 4 AM cleans up any incomplete prayers from yesterday
- ‚úÖ No performance impact (no multi-day checking every 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Grace period extended to 4 hours (00:00-04:00) for late prayer logging

### Code Quality
- **Zero flutter analyze issues** - All changes pass static analysis with no errors or warnings

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-22

### Fixed - Statistics Real-Time Updates
- **Fixed statistics not refreshing when prayer data changes**
  - Converted `selectedMonthStatsProvider` from static `Provider` to reactive `StreamProvider` in `stats_providers.dart`
  - Converted `prayerWiseStatsProvider` from static `Provider` to reactive `StreamProvider` in `stats_providers.dart`
  - Both providers now use Hive's `.watch()` to listen for database changes
  - Statistics page now updates instantly when prayers are marked from any screen (home, calendar, notifications)
  - Users can switch to statistics page and see changes immediately without needing to reopen the app
  - Updated all widgets consuming these providers to handle `AsyncValue` pattern:
    - `stats_summary.dart` - Added loading and error states
    - `stats_chart.dart` - Added loading and error states
    - `prayer_wise_breakdown.dart` - Added loading and error states

### Fixed - Statistics Calculation Fairness
- **Fixed statistics calculation to respect app installation date**
  - Previously calculated total prayers as `days in month √ó 5`, which was unfair for users who installed mid-month
  - Example: User installing on October 15th showed stats as if they should have prayed all 31 days (155 prayers), making them appear to have missed prayers before app installation
  - Modified `getMonthlyStats()` in `prayer_repository.dart` to use installation date as effective start
  - Modified `getPrayerWiseStats()` in `prayer_repository.dart` to calculate accessible days based on installation date
  - Added `_calculateAccessiblePrayersInMonth()` helper method that:
    - Determines effective start date (later of month start or installation date)
    - Returns 0 if installation date is after month end (future months)
    - Calculates accurate prayer count: `accessible days √ó 5`
  - Added `_calculateAccessibleDaysInMonth()` helper method for per-prayer statistics
  - Statistics now only count prayers from installation date onwards
  - Fair and accurate representation of user's actual prayer performance

### Enhanced - Installation Date Tracking
- **Installation date tracking already implemented** (verified from existing codebase)
  - `main.dart` sets installation date on first launch in `_setInstallationDateIfNotExists()`
  - Uses earliest prayer log date if data exists, otherwise uses current date
  - Stored in SharedPreferences with key `keyInstallationDate`
  - Repository methods like `isDateAccessible()`, `getLogsForDateRange()`, and `_getValidStartDate()` already respect installation date
  - Statistics calculation now also respects this date for fair representation

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/features/statistics/providers/stats_providers.dart` - Made providers reactive with StreamProvider
  - `lib/features/statistics/widgets/stats_summary.dart` - Added AsyncValue handling
  - `lib/features/statistics/widgets/stats_chart.dart` - Added AsyncValue handling
  - `lib/features/statistics/widgets/prayer_wise_breakdown.dart` - Added AsyncValue handling
  - `lib/features/prayers/repositories/prayer_repository.dart` - Updated statistics calculation methods

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Statistics refresh instantly when prayers are marked from any screen
- ‚úÖ No need to close and reopen the app to see updated statistics
- ‚úÖ Statistics accurately reflect prayers from installation date onwards
- ‚úÖ Users who install mid-month see fair statistics (not penalized for pre-installation days)
- ‚úÖ Future months show 0 accessible prayers (user hasn't reached them yet)
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience with loading and error states

### Removed - UI Simplification
- **Removed prayer-wise breakdown section from statistics screen**
  - Removed the star rating section that showed individual prayer statistics (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, etc.)
  - Statistics screen now shows only: Overall Performance and Breakdown by Type chart
  - Cleaner, more focused statistics view
  - Removed `PrayerWiseBreakdown` widget import from `statistics_screen.dart`
  - Widget file still exists at `lib/features/statistics/widgets/prayer_wise_breakdown.dart` (can be restored if needed)

### Code Quality
- **Zero flutter analyze issues** - All changes pass static analysis with no errors or warnings
- Proper trailing commas for Flutter formatting
- Consistent with existing reactive provider patterns (matches `monthlyStatsProvider` in `home_providers.dart`)
- Clean error handling with user-friendly error messages
